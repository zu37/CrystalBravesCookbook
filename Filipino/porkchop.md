# Pork Chops
How I and I my mom would make pork chop at home. While the recipe is simple, it requires a 30 minute to 2 hour marination, so take that into consideration. 
Optionally, you can brine the pork over night before marinating for better texture if you have the time. 
## Ingredients (Serves 6)
### Main
- 6 center cut pork loin rib chops, preferably bone-in and about 1/2-inch thick
- cooking oil for frying (something neutral like canola)

### Marinade
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
- 1/2 cup soy sauce
- 1/4 cup calamansi juice
- 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced

## Instructions
1. Rinse the pork chops and pat dry. Poke holes with the tip of a knife. Season with pepper to taste.
2. In a bowl, combine soy sauce, calamansi juice, and garlic.
3. Add pork chops, massaging marinade onto meat. Cover with film (or transfer into a resealable bag) and marinate in refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours. Drain pork chops well, discarding marinade.
4. In a pan over medium-high heat, heat oil until hot but not smoking.
5. Add pork chops and pan-fry for about 2 to 3 minutes or until nicely seared. Turn to the other side and continue to cook for another 1 to 2 minutes or until nicely seared and a thermometer in the center reads 145 F.
6. Remove from pan and let rest for about 2 to 3 minutes before slicing.
7. Perfect on top of rice (ON TOP, NOT ON THE SIDE) with something acidic on the side like atchara or kimchi
