# Arroz Caldo  
I consider this the pinoy chicken soup for the soul, really good and filling, and very scalable. 
## Ingredients 
### Main
- 2/3 cup canola oil, divided
- 1/4 cup freshly minced garlic (about 12 medium cloves), divided
- 2 medium onions, thinly sliced
- 1 piece of ginger
- 1kg boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces 
- 2 tablespoon fish sauce
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste
- 2 cups uncooked rice
- 6 cups chicken stock
- 1 tablespoon calamansi, key lime, or lime juice 
- 1 tsp of turmeric (to add color, safflower is usually added but it might be hard to acquire) 
- salt to taste

### Toppings
- 4 scallions, thinly sliced
- 2 hard-boiled eggs, cut into 1/4-inch slices 
- 2 fresh limes or calamansi, quartered

## Instructions
1. Place 1/2 cup of oil and two-thirds of the garlic in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until garlic turns light golden brown. Transfer garlic to fine mesh strainer and drain. Spread garlic out on a paper towel-lined plate and set aside.

2. Heat remaining oil in a large Dutch oven or soup pot over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add ginger and remaining garlic and cook for 1 minute longer. Add chicken and cook until browned all over. Stir in fish sauce, pepper, and turmeric and cook for 1 minute. Add rice and stir until well coated.

4. Stir in chicken stock, running spoon along bottom of Dutch oven to release any browned bits. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until rice is completely tender and stock has thickened, about 20 minutes. Stir in lime or calamansi juice and season with salt and pepper to taste.

4. Ladle arroz caldo into bowls. Top with scallions, fried garlic, and egg slices, if using. Serve immediately with additional lime or calamansi wedges on the side.
