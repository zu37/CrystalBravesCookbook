Because nothing says japanese home cooked comfort food better than reuniting a mother and her child in a bowl.
## Ingredients (Serves 1)

- Chicken Thigh - 150g (trim the skin, but if you don't want to waste it, sear the chicken skin-side down first before you slice it)
- Onion half, sliced/chopped - 60g
- Ginger, minced - 5g
- Garlic, minced - 5g
- Star anise, 1/4 piece (optional)
- Bay leaf, 1/4 piece (optional)
- Pepper, to taste
- Riced, cooked to serve (your preferred serving size)

### Sauce/Marinade
- Water - 50ml 
- Sugar, 1 tsp - 5g 
- Soy sauce, 4 tsp - 20ml
- Sake, 2 tsp - 10ml
- Mirin, 1 tsp - 5ml 
- Kombu - 1g 

## Instructions

### Ingredient Prep
- Cut chicken into 1-2 cm cubes.
- Mix marinade.
- Soak chicken, leave for 30-40 mins.
- Slice onions and mince ginger.
- Whisk egg to about 70-80%

### Cooking
- On a small cold pan, pour vegetable oil, add the ginger, cook on low heat.
- When ginger starts to release its aroma, add onion. Cook on medium heat for 3-4 mins. (Optional: season with pepper. I really like my food peppery)
- Once they become slightly soft, take it off from the heat. Cool for 5-6 mins.
- Put the pan back on low heat, add the chicken and marinade. Boil slowly. (7-8 mins)
- Cook until chicken is bouncy and firm but not overcooked. Discard the kombu.
- Turn the heat on medium high then add egg. Leave for a few seconds without mixing, then shake the pan a little bit to prevent sticking.
- Slightly stir mixture then turn off heat.
- Top on a bowl of rice. Season with shichimi togarashi or pepper.
