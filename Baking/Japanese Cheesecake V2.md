#Japanese Cheesecake V2

## Ingredients
- 300 g cream cheese
- 200 ml heavy whipping cream
- 60 g unsalted butter (+extra for greasing pan and papers, or use margarine/cooking spray)
- 60 g sugar (for cream cheese mixture)
- 6 large eggs, separated
- 80 g cake flour
- 30 ml lemon or calamansi juice
- lemon or calamansi zest (from about 1/2 lemon or 6 calamansi)
- 100 g sugar (for meringue)
- honey (for topping; you can also use other types of topping e.g. jam, preserves, confectioner's sugar, etc.)

Note: if possible, have the cream cheese, whipping cream, butter at room temp. if not, you can use a double boiler. 

### Tools
- 9 x 4 inch cake pan
- Baking sheet, roasting pan, or whatever deep pan that can fit the cake pan for a bain-marie
- Parchment paper
- Stand mixer 
- Medium saucepan if using double boiler method
- Fine mesh strainer
- Mixing bowls
- Whisk

## Cake Pan Prep
- Cut parchment paper to line the bottom and sides of the cake pan. Cut one circle 9 inches in diameter for the bottom and one rectangular strip 4-inches wide by 30-inches long for the sides of the cake pan. Also, cut two more  strips of paper 2-inches wide by 30-inches long for use as lifting straps.

- Grease the cake pan and parchment paper (for the bottom and the sides) with butter, margarine or spray. Place the two smaller strips on the bottom of the cake pan so they form a cross. Allow the excess paper to hang over the sides. Then, line the bottom and sides with the prepared parchment paper. The greased side of the paper circle should face up, and the greased side of the rectangular strip should face in toward the center of the pan.

## Main Prep
- Preheat the oven to 180ºC.

- Measure all your ingredients.

-  Separate the 6 eggs. Refrigerate the egg whites (if your fridge has space, refrigerate them in a stand mixer bowl - helps in making meringue)

- If using a double boiler, set a medium saucepan filled with 2 inches of water over high heat and bring to a simmer. Once simmering, cover and reduce the heat to maintain a steady simmer.

## Cake Batter 

- (Using a double boiler) In a stand mixer bowl, add cream cheese, unsalted butter, heavy whipping cream, and granulated sugar. Put the bowl over the saucepan with the simmering water. Using a silicone spatula, mash the cream cheese and butter. Once they are melted, use a whisk to blend everything together. Remove from the heat.

- (Without using a double boiler) In a stand mixer bowl, add cream cheese, unsalted butter, heavy whipping cream, and granulated sugar. Using a silicone spatula, mash the cream cheese and butter. Place in stand mixer with the whisk attachment and mix until well melted and blended.

- While whisking, add the 6 egg yolks into the warm cream cheese mixture, one at a time. Make sure each egg yolk is blended well with the cream cheese mixture before adding the next one.

- Using a fine-mesh strainer, sift the cake flour into the batter. Whisk and blend together. Then pass the batter through the same fine mesh strainer into another bowl, for a smoother consistency.

- Add zest and juice. Whisk well to blend and set aside.

## Bain-Marie Prep
- Put the baking sheet inside the oven and pour in hot water until it is halfway up the sides or 1-inch deep. Close the oven door.

## Meringue Prep
- Add the cold egg whites into the large clean mixing bowl of a stand mixer. Make sure there is no oil or water in the bowl. Start whisking on medium speed until the egg whites become opaque, foamy, and bubbly, about 2 minutes. 

- Then slowly add sugar, one-third portion at a time while the mixer runs.
Once you’ve added all the sugar, increase the mixer speed to high and beat the egg whites until you have soft to medium peaks.

- Using a whisk, mix one-third of the egg whites into the cream cheese mixture until incorporated. Then gently fold another one-third into the mixture. Lastly, pour the mixture back into the mixer bowl (with one-third of the egg whites still in it) and fold very gently.

- Pour the mixture into the cake pan all at once, avoiding air pockets while pouring. Tap the cake pan a few times on the kitchen counter to release any air pockets in the batter.

## Baking
- Place the cake pan on the baking sheet with the bain-marie that’s already in the oven. Reduce the oven temperature to 160ºC and bake for 70-75 minutes. Then, reduce the oven temperature to 150ºC and bake for another 10 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a skewer inserted comes out clean. For a convection oven, reduce the cooking temperature by 15ºC.

## Cooling & Topping
- Turn off the oven and leave the oven door slightly ajar for 15-20 minutes with the cake inside. If taken out immediately, the cake will collapse. 

- Remove the pan from the oven. Gently pull out the cake from the pan using the two parchment paper straps (easier with two people </3). Remove the remaining parchment paper except for the bottom circle parchment.

- Apply your topping of choice. If it's too thick, add a tbsp of hot water or microwave it. Let cake cool to room temp and serve or chill in the fridge.
