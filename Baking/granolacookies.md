# Granola Cookies
## Ingredients:
- 2 cups (260 grams) all purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon (4 grams) baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon (1 gram) salt
- 14 tablespoons (200 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 100 grams granulated white sugar
- 100 grams firmly packed light brown sugar
- 1 large egg (about 50 grams without shell), at room temperature
- 1 large egg yolk (18 grams), at room temperature
- 1 1/2 teaspoons (6 grams) pure vanilla extract
- cinnamon powder
- 150 grams granola
- extra granola for sprinkling on top of unbaked cookies

## Instructions:
1. Pre-heat oven to 180c 
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.
3. In the bowl of your electric stand mixer, fitted with the paddle attachment (or with a hand mixer or with a mixing bowl and elbow grease), beat the butter until smooth. Add the sugars and beat until creamy and smooth. Scrape down the sides and bottom of your bowl as needed. Add the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract and beat until well combined.
4. Add the flour mixture to the creamed mixture and beat just until incorporated. Stir or beat in the granola. If the batter is quite soft, cover and refrigerate until firm (about 30-60 minutes).
5. For large cookies, take about 1/4 cup (50 grams) of batter and form it into a round ball (can also use an ice cream scoop). Place six balls of batter on each baking sheet, spacing them several inches apart (about 10 cm). With the palm of your hand, gently flatten each ball into a round. If desired, sprinkle a little granola on the tops of the unbaked cookies. Bake the cookies for about 14 - 16 minutes, or until golden brown around the edges but still a little soft in the center. (The longer you bake the cookies the more crispy they will be.) Rotate your baking sheet front to back about halfway through the baking time. Remove from oven and place on a cooling rack. Let the cookies cool for about five minutes on the baking sheet before transferring to a wire rack to finish cooling. The baked cookies can be stored in an airtight container for about three days.
