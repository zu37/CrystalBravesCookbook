# Zu's Barley Risotto (ish) 
## Ingredients (makes about 3-4 servings)
- 2 tbsp butter 
- olive oil
- 1 large shallot or equivalent (half a large onion, etc.), finely sliced (makes about 1 cup)
- 1 medium carrot, diced (about 1/2 cup)
- 1 stalk of celery, diced (about 1/2 cup)
- 1 garlic clove, chopped (my filipino blood compels me to use half a garlic bulb so that's 4-5 cloves)
- 150-200g mushrooms (can be shiitake, or champignon, white, brown, portobello, etc.)
- 100g pearl barley 
- 100g short grain rice (orzo, arborio, japanese, etc.)
- 150ml white wine
- 1 chicken bouillon cube
- 1/2 L of hot water
- dried or fresh thyme, to taste 
- 3 tbsp grated parmesan
- salt and pepper, to taste
- Optional:
- chicken or beef (i feel like pork would make the dish too oily), I usually use 300g of ground beef. If using chicken, cut into small chunks. If you decide to not add protein, you can increase the amount of mushrooms
- vegetable oil (if you are using a protein)
- snipped chives for garnish
- 6g tomato paste (adds a little more depth of flavor and umami but more importantly for me, color)
- parmesan for garnish (grated or shaved)
- lemon zest or lemon juice (the acidity is a good complement to the richness of the risotto)

## Instructions
- If you decided to use a protein, heat up the pan (medium-high), put vegetable oil and sear/brown it first, then set aside
- Using the same pan, add enough olive oil to cover the pan. If the pan is already covered in oil from searing your protein, add about a tablespoon. 
- Once it heats up again melt 1 tbsp of butter (you will use the butter again later) and add all your vegetables and mushrooms. 
- Add about several pinches of salt (this is to taste) to help draw the water out and soften the vegetables. 
- Occassionally stir, cook until your mirepoix is softened and starts to get color.
- Stir in your protein and cook for 2 minutes.
- Add barley and rice and cook for 1 minute.
- Pour in wine, and let it absorb, while stirring occassionally to prevent burning.
- Once the wine has been absorbed or evaporated, add a chicken bouillion cube and pour in water until everything is covered. Stir everything so that all the grains will be hydrated.
- Bring the risotto to a boil then turn down the heat to a simmer for 40 minutes or so until the barley and rice are fully cooked*, while occassionally stirring.
- Remember to add more hot water when the risotto dries up. 
- When the barley and rice are cooked, take of the heat and add the remaining 1 tbsp of butter and parmesan cheese and thoroughly mix. 
- Serve hot, topped with chives and shaved/grated parmesan and lemon zest/juice, you can also choose to side it with something like garlic bread

## Tips
- *if you take a grain and bite into it and the middle is still very dry and crumbly, it's not yet done (similar to pasta)
- make sure to dice your vegetables and mushrooms to about the same size for a uniform risotto (except the garlic, chop that to much smaller pieces)
- if you don't like to use white wine, you can substitute with a few teaspoons of lemon juice (you're mostly adding wine to get a little acidity), although you might need more water.
