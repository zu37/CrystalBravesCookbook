# How to List a New Recipe

1. First, create a file ![Create a File](/howtolistanewrecipe/1.png)

2. Then, name your file as an .md file (preferably without spaces so it's easier to put in the table of contents) ![Name a File](/howtolistanewrecipe/2.png) Place it in a "Folder" with the use of backslashes (github can't create empty folders) e.g. "/Dinner/Steak.md"

3. Begin writing your recipe, using this as a template: ![Recipe Template](/howtolistanewrecipe/3.png) Remember to use proper headers!
